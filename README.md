Resticus is a lightweight set of tools for implementing JSON-based
RESTful APIs in Django. It helps with writing APIs that loosely follow
the RESTful paradigm, without forcing you to do so, and without imposing a
full-blown REST framework.

Resticus provides only JSON support. If you need to support XML or
other formats, you probably want to take a look at some of the other frameworks
out there (we recommend Django REST framework).

Here is a simple view implementing an API endpoint greeting the caller:

    from restless.views import Endpoint

    class HelloWorld(Endpoint):
        def get(self, request):
            name = request.params.get('name', 'World')
            return {'message': 'Hello, %s!' % name}

One of the main ideas behind Resticus is that it's lightweight and reuses
as much of functionality in Django as possible. For example, input parsing and
validation is done using standard Django forms. This means you don't have to
learn a whole new API to use Resticus.
